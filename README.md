# Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-System

**Used:** Python, Google colab, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib 

Built machine learning and deep learning models to predict urban traffic congestion levels using time-series traffic data. Implemented Random Forest, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models with hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques. 

Preprocessed and engineered features from raw traffic datasets. 

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection. 

Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics. 

Delivered a comprehensive analysis report with model comparison and performance justification.
